# Summarizing the results for our Research Questions (RQs)

Table 1: Summarizing the results for time completion (RQ1). Bold font represents statistically significant differences. U = undisciplined annotations; D = disciplined annotations; PD = percentage difference; PV = p-value; ES = effect size. Columns U and D are based on the median as a measure of central tendency.

##### Finding 1: In our study, after applying R1 or R3 in isolation, the novices exhibit faster task completion. Faster task completion is also exhibited by the novices after applying R1, R2, and R3 in combination.

Table 2: Summarizing the results for the accuracy (RQ2). Bold font represents statistically significant differences. U = undisciplined annotations; D = disciplined annotations; PD = percentage difference; PV = p-value; ES = effect size. Columns U and D are based on the median as a measure of central tendency.

##### Finding 2: In our study, after applying R3 in isolation, the novices provide more correct answers. No differences were observed after applying R1, R2, and R3 in combination.

Table 3: Summarizing the results for the accuracy (RQ3). Bold font represents statistically significant differences. U = undisciplined annotations; D = disciplined annotations; PD = percentage difference; PV = p-value; ES = effect size. Columns U and D are based on the median as a measure of central tendency.

##### Finding 3: In our study, after applying R1 or R3 in isolation, the novices exhibit a reduction in the fixation duration in the AOI. A reduction in the fixation duration in the AOI is also exhibited by the novices after applying R1, R2, and R3 in combination.
--------------

Table 4: Summarizing the results for the accuracy (RQ4). Bold font represents statistically significant differences. U = undisciplined annotations; D = disciplined annotations; PD = percentage difference; PV = p-value; ES = effect size. Columns U and D are based on the median as a measure of central tendency.

Table 5: Summarizing the results for regressions count (RQ5). Bold font represents statistically significant differences. U = undisciplined annotations; D = disciplined annotations; PD = percentage difference; PV = p-value; ES = effect size. Columns U and D are based on the median as a measure of central tendency.
